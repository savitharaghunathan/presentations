## Description:
SIG Security takes a community-building approach to improving Kubernetes security, both for the project itself and our end users. Join organizers Pushkar, Rey, Savitha, and Tabitha for an overview of how we make space for security collaboration to thrive. We'll share timely updates from our tooling and third-party audit subgroups and information about guided security self-assessments for Kubernetes subprojects. In closing, a deep-dive into our efforts to improve security documentation through blogs, tutorials, whitepapers, and goose honking! You'll learn what's been going on, whatâ€™s next, and how you could join in, regardless of your experience from beginner to expert. We hope to see you there!
