Stop Kubernetes' Revolving Door: A Hands-On Workshop to Secure a Kubernetes Cluster

Out-of-the-box, upstream Kubernetes is not secure by-default. Attendees of this hands-on workshop will walk through the official/upstream Kubernetes Security Checklist to set up a cluster securely.

The workshop starts with an introduction to the critical security considerations for Kubernetes environments. Participants will then embark on a guided journey through practical exercises designed to implement security best practices within Kubernetes clusters.

Throughout the workshop, attendees will gain firsthand experience in securing Kubernetes environments, covering aspects such as authentication, authorization, network policies, pod security, and more. These exercises will provide participants a comprehensive understanding of Kubernetes security principles and practical implementation techniques.

Attendees will walk away equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively secure Kubernetes clusters in real-world scenarios. Whether you're new to Kubernetes security or seeking to enhance your existing expertise, this workshop offers valuable insights and hands-on experience to strengthen your Kubernetes deployments against potential threats.
