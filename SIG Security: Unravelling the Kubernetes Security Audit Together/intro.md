SIG Security takes a community-building approach to improving Kubernetes security, both for the project itself and for our end users. Join organizers Ala, Pushkar, Rey, and Savitha for an overview of SIG Security and timely updates from our Documentation, Self-assessments, and Tooling subprojects. You'll learn what's been going on, whatâ€™s next, and how you could join in. Our Third-party Security Audit subproject will be a special focus. With 111 new Stable enhancements, Kubernetes has really matured since the previous audit in 2019! It takes teamwork to coordinate such a big audit, and we will share that process including the CFP, the audit itself, and internal review with the Security Response Committee. We will also share the vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations uncovered by the April 2023 audit. SIG Security has something to learn and contribute for every experience level, from beginner to expert. We hope to see you there!
