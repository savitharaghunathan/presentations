As the great Benjamin Franklin said, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” As business leaders and technical leaders driving digital transformation with open source technologies, building a learning culture within your organization will be your secret sauce (or competitive advantage). In this interactive presentation, we go through considerations Red Hat took when taking a community-first approach to our Kubernetes and Cloud Native learning community, Kube by Example (KBE). We’ll share the steps it took to build the community and how we found our customers, such as Ford Motor Company, adopting our “community-first” approach on their cloud native transformation journey.
