## Description
CNCF is the vendor-neutral home for cloud native projects. Including the most famous open source project in recent times, Kubernetes, it currently houses ~1,019 cards with a total of 2,957,938 stars. With a growing ecosystem, at an initial glance, the landscape may seem intimidating to newcomers, especially students. Journeying through the entire development and operations lifecycle, this panel aims to take a guided approach to cover the various projects involved right from the creation of the application to the deployment & monitoring. With various pit stops & forks along the way, the speakers hope to leave the audience with a fair idea of how to navigate the landscape effectively and embark on their cloud native journey. Should they also wish to contribute to any of the projects, the session also covers various tips & tricks on how to take their very first steps in the ecosystem as well.
