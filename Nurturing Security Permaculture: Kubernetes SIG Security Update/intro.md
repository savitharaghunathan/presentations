SIG Security takes a community-building approach to improving Kubernetes security, both for the project itself and our end users. Join contributors Savitha, Ala, Mahé, and Tabitha for an overview of how we make space for security collaboration to thrive. We'll share timely updates from our documentation, third-party audit, self-assessments, and tooling subprojects. You'll learn what's been going on, what’s next, and how you could join in, regardless of your experience from beginner to expert. We hope to see you there!
