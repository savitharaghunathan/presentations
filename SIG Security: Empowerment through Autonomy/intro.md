SIG Security takes a community-building approach to improving Kubernetes security, both for the project itself and our end users. Join organizers Ala, Rey, Savitha, and Tabitha for an overview of how we make space for security collaboration to thrive. We'll share timely updates from our documentation, third-party audit, and tooling subprojects. Security self-assessments will be a special focus, with a deep-dive on this new service offered to Kubernetes by our newest subproject! The Self-Assessments subproject in SIG Security is here to make security introspection accessible to any and all SIGs and subprojects. We aim to give SIGs and subprojects a repeatable and rigorous way to think about their own security, making Kubernetes safer to use as more workloads find their way to it. You'll learn what's been going on, whatâ€™s next, and how you could join in, regardless of your experience from beginner to expert. We hope to see you there!
