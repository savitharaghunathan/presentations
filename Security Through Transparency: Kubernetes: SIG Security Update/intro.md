## Description
Kubernetes SIG Security is a newer SIG, dedicated to improving Kubernetes security by providing space for learning together, sharing our expertise, and building bridges between SIGS and externally with the broader security community. We’re here this KubeCon to tell you about what we’ve been up to! Come for this session featuring updates from our docs, tooling, and third party security audit subgroups about our efforts to keep Kubernetes secure through transparency, not obscurity. Stay to learn how you can get involved. Happy Honking!
